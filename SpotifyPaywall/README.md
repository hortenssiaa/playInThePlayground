## #10. Spotify Paywall App

### What's For?
- You can see the page bar changes when the view slides through pagecontrol.

### Used Class
- UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource

### What I Learned?
- Through visibleItemsInvalidationHandler, I was able to know the location of the x and y axes as much as the view was offset.
